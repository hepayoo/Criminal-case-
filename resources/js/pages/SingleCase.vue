        <p>Jeffrey Dahmer was born inÂ Milwaukee, the son of Lionel Herbert Dahmer (1936â€“2023), a chemist, and his wife Joyce Annette, nÃ©e Flint (1936â€“2000).</p><br>
        <p>He is of German, Welsh, Norwegian, and Irish descent. Joyce Dahmer experienced difficulties while pregnant with Jeffrey and became depressed. Seven years later, in 1966, she gave birth to another boy, David.</p>
        <p>When Jeffrey was eight, he and his family moved to Bath, Ohio. Jeffrey Dahmer had very few social interactions between the ages of 10 and 15. During this time, he would roam his neighborhood looking for dead animals, which he would bring to his home and dissect, nailing animals to tree trunks, including a dog's head impaled on a branch.</p><br>
        <p>AtÂ pubertyÂ , he discovered hisÂ homosexuality, which he hid from his parents.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Dahmer began drinking during his adolescence, always having a flask of alcohol in his schoolbag or jacket, and becameÂ an alcoholicÂ during his university years.</p>

        <p>Dahmer killed a 26-year-old man, Steven Tuomi, in a hotel on impulse; he later explained that he did not remember committing the crime. After Tuomi's murder, Dahmer continued to kill sporadically: two more murders in 1988, and another in early 1989, in which he took his victims to bars before killing them. He still had the skeleton of one of his victims, Anthony Sears, when he was arrested.</p><br>
        <p>InMay 1990, he leaves his grandmother's home for the last time for an apartment that will later become unsanitary: apartment 213, 924 North 25th Street, Milwaukee . Jeffrey Dahmer continues his murders: four more murders before the end of 1990 and several victims during the year 1991.</p><br>
        <p>During the summer of 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer stalked gay bars in Milwaukee and Chicago , seeking out victims whom he then invited into his home. He murdered one man approximately every week, and had sexual intercourse with most of the victims. He killed Matt Turner onJune 30, Jeremiah Weinberger theJuly 7th, Oliver Lacy theJuly 12to finish with Joseph Brandehoft theJuly 19whom he invites to his home with the offer of money. After killing Brandehoft, he cuts off his head and puts it in his refrigerator. Dahmer believes he can turn his victims into "zombies" by drilling holes in their skulls with an electric drill, and injecting hydrochloric acid or boiling water into their frontal lobes while his victims are still alive. Neighbors regularly smell strange odors emanating from Apartment 213.</p>
